          <strong>Obstructive sleep apnoea</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">

          Was diagnosed by a specialist in 2007 but did not have a sleep study until 2022. He has been given a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. He was referred for further sleep studies. <br><br> He had surgery for deviated septum (dividing wall in nose) in 2006 and he also had a revision 1 year ago. <br><br>He had his full sleep study and this showed a spike in central events - he had a sleep endoscopy (camera) last Tuesday, there is an issue with his tongue base which could be affecting his apnoea and he needs to have surgery for this. <br><br> He is under the care of the specialist and is awaiting surgery. He states that he has been diagnosed with central sleep apnoea and he has been advised to start using a full ventilator (Bi-level positive airway pressure BPAP) and is due further studies for this at the end of the month. He will spend time in hospital for this for 3 nights.<br><br> He states that he is able to breathe better since his surgery last year. However with his sleep apnoea, he is suffering with fatigue daily and this has always been a problem. He thought that his fatigue was due to exercising but still suffers with this when he is not exercising. <br><br> This becomes worse mid morning, he takes cold showers to wake up and needs to have a sleep at 3pm for 20 minutes and he will always set an alarm for this but occasionally at times will sleep for 30-45 minutes. This helps him to reset his energy levels and to refocus. <br><br>He states that his symptoms have worsened as he has gotten older - over the last 10 years. He takes magnesium supplements at night for this to help with the fatigue. He suffers with loss of concentration and focus daily.<br><br> Most days, 3-4 days a week he wakes up with a headache.<br><br> He has never had to be an inpatient as a result of this other than his sleep studies. <br><br>He states that he has stepped onto the road twice without looking due to loss of focus, last time was in 2023 sometime, no injuries occurred.

          <strong>Fibromyalgia</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">
          He was diagnosed by his GP in 2012 and started on pain relief. He tried different medications for pain which did not work. He then took Tramadol (pain relief) for 4 years, he then moved to America for a while, took pain relief there but came off this. He no longer takes Tramadol but does use over the counter pain relief. <br><br> He was referred to pain management but did not attend as the referral was lost - he states that he has since been re-referred to the pain management service 1 month ago.<br><br> He states that his GP has discussed him being referred to weight managed as he nearly obese on the weight scale (BMI - body mass index). He has not been referred to any other services. <br><br> Day to day he experiences symptoms of forgetfulness - fibro fog, feeling overpowered with pain in his shoulders (worse on the right side), lower right side of his back and hip as well as both ankles where he has a lot of tension when he walks. His knees and elbows are ok. <br><br> He suffers with fatigue also but is not sure what is related to his sleep apnoea. He feels that his symptoms have worsened over time, more so since 2021. He reports no variability. He has not needed to stay in hospital as a result of this.
          <br><br>
          Myofacial pain syndrome (long term pain condition were pressure on areas - trigger points, causes pain). He was diagnosed by a specialist last year. He was referred to an orthodontist due to him wearing a mouth guard for 20 years but there is no other treatment planned. He experiences pain symptoms - he is unable to differentiate this from his fibromyalgia pain and this follows the same above history. He takes over the counter pain relief but feels that his left sided jaw pain is the worst.

          <strong>Chronic back pain</strong>
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">

          He was diagnosed by his GP in 2004 and had several appointments with physiotherapy. He last saw the physio a month ago, he was given some home exercises and will have a follow up in 3 months. He takes over the counter pain relief.<br><br> He had a scan of his back in 2015 which showed a disc bulge in lumber spine at L4. He did see a specialist in 2011 and 2015 for his back but not since. He is under GP care.<br><br> He states that this is the most frustrating pain of all. It is in his lower back - states that suffers with tilted pelvis when he walks which causes a strain on his lower back. Running is also painful and now only does cross training at the gym. Sitting is also painful, needs to stand up after 30 minutes.<br><br> When he is asleep, he has to lay in his side as it hurts to lay on his back - as he will suffer with radiating pain down to his thigh.<br><br> He has not had surgery or pain relief injections for his back. He has not needed to attend hospital as an inpatient for this back but did attend the urgent care centre after attending the gym, following a warm down stretch where he felt a pop in his back - he needed to rest at home for 2 weeks on pain relief. This was in 2013. <br><br>His pain overall has worsened over time since 2021. There is no variability in his symptoms day to day.
          <br><br>
          Reports issues with muscle flinching in his right arm since 2016. This can also occur in his left arm. This is being evaluated as it could be a result of central nervous system activity. He has spoken with his sleep specialists about this and his partner has told him that he has limb flinching in his sleep. He has not been diagnosed with anything as yet but he will be assessed when he has his further sleep studies. <br><br>He is not sure if he has restless leg syndrome. He has not been given any medication for this. With his right arm flinching, this is daily and hourly, it is not constant. His left arm is left often but is still hourly. He feels that the muscle is weaker on his right forearm - it feels weaker when he pushes it. The leg flinching occurs just at night time. <br><br>He feels the symptoms are more frequent now but intensity has not worsened. This will cause him to do involuntary mouse clicks when on the computer or press the wrong button on his phone. This has not resulted in him needing to attend hospital. He later states that he has started to flinch his bicep on right arm, this started middle of last year, this is occurs hourly and is variable within the hour. There is no trigger for these flinches.

          <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">


          Joint pain in the last 1990s, leading to jaw soreness due to bruxism (teeth grinding) , a result of night time teeth grinding.<br><br> Reports that he has been wearing a mouth guard for 20 years which was prescribed, this has moved his jaw forward and has affected his speech. He has been seeing the dentist for this over the years. He has been referred to an orthodontist for this now due to movement in his jaw. <br><br>He suffers with left sided jaw pain all of the time and feels exhausted as a result of this. He states that his jaw is asymmetric (not symmetrical) to his left side. He does not feel that he can open and close his jaw properly as it is too tight. Some days it is ok, some days he cannot talk and is
          more fatigued. <br><br>He then states that his talking ability is more due to his fatigue, 1-2 times a week more so towards the end of the day. <br><br>He has sliced his tongue open in the past (2003 and attended A&E - had some stitches at the time) and well as biting his lips almost daily when eating his food. He has not needed to attend A&E since slicing his tongue open in 2003.

          <strong>FibromyalgiaDepressive disorder</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">

          This first started when he had severe acne in his early 20's. He then moved to London for a job and had a difficult manager, the stress of moving to London by himself, exacerbated his stress. <br><br>He was diagnosed with work related stress and then anxiety. He was off work for 4 months in 2010. He was then diagnosed with depression. <br><br>He still has acne but this has improved and manages this himself. <br><br>He was prescribed anti depressants in 2010 for 6 months which helped, he got better but was off the following year with depression. He was then better for 4 years. <br><br>His depression has since worsened due to his fatigue and pain in the last couple of years and this was compounded by a break up in 2022. <br><br>He states that he saw a psychiatrist in 2022, was seen by them for 6 months - on 3 occasions. He has not seen anyone since then for his mental health other than his GP.<br><br> He last took medication for his mental health (anti depressant) in early 2023 for 3 months. He does not feel that the medication has worked, he does feel that he may need therapy but there are no other plans for treatment. He is under GP care. He later states that he was given an anti anxiety medication by his GP in 1998 which he took for 3 months. <br><br>Day to day he experiences symptoms of forgetfulness, slurred speech, problems organising his thoughts in a coherent way. He has negative thoughts of past and overthinks these when he is alone, in a meditative state. This results in him contemplating his life. <br><br>He does not have any hallucinations or intrusive thoughts and states that he is in control of his thoughts. He states that he would never commit suicide or harm himself. He did have passing thoughts of committing suicide 2022 but did look at how he could take his own life on one occasion in September 2022 as he was in a dark place after a breakup, this was reactive at the time and more about ending the heart break in which he was able to talk himself out of.<br><br> He has protective factors of his faith and went to his place of worship the next day after this thought in 2022. He also has protective factors of his partner. He has not felt this way since then. He has never been admitted to hospital or been an inpatient for his mental health. He has never been under the CRISIS team or home treatment team. His psychiatrist at the time was aware of his suicidal ideation.<br><br> He reports no variability in his symptoms in relation to his mental health, he feels that his mental health has stayed the same since he last saw his GP about this. He takes no current medication.
          <br><br>
          He was referred for an assessment for autism in 2021. He however moved out of the area and this did not occur. He was referred by a psychiatrist at the time.<br><br> He states that he was diagnosed with dyslexia as a teenager and his psychiatrist thought a further assessment may have been needed after he filled in some questionnaires. There are no plans as yet to refer him again for an assessment. <br><br>He states that he suffers with forgetfulness, slow speech, confusion, not thinking clearly, memory problems, problems with social interaction, problems with picking up social queues. He states that this is not variable. <br><br>His dyslexia was diagnosed by an educational psychologist and he had support in school - coloured sheets and extra time in exams were given. When he went to university he had dragon software to read things out for him. He states that he no longer uses any colour screens or software to help him read. He went to a main stream school. He takes no medication for this.
