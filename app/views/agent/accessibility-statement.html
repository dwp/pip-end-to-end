        Accessibility statement for Personal Independence Payment
      </h1>

        <p>This accessibility statement applies to the Personal Independence Payment service.</p>

        <p>This service is run by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings</li>
            <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
            <li>navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>
            <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
          </ul>

        <p>We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

        <p><a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How accessible this website is</h2>
        
        <p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>some data inputs are not retained when a validation error occurs, or when a user navigates away from a page and then selects the ‘back’ link to return to it</li>
          <li>sortable table headings and content are not fully accessible to screen reader software</li>
          <li>it is not immediately clear to screen readers that a validation error is present on the screen</li>
          <li>you can only skip to hyperlinks and sortable column headings on some of the pages</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Feedback and contact information</h2>

          <p>We are always looking to improve the accessibility of this service. If you find any problems that are not listed on this page or think we're not meeting accessibility requirements email <a href="mailto:quarryhouse.applyforpip-accessibility@dwp.gov.uk">quarryhouse.applyforpip-accessibility@dwp.gov.uk</a>.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Enforcement procedure</h2>

          <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the 'accessibility regulations'). If you are not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.</p>
          
          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
          
          <p>The Department for Work and Pensions is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
          
          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Compliance status</h2>

          <p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>

          <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Retaining data</h4>

          <p>Data that has been entered in one of the text fields is not retained in the text field when a validation error occurs, or when the user navigates to another page and then selects the ‘Back’ link to return to it. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.7 (redundant entry).</p>
          <p>Radio selection on one of the pages is not retained when a user navigates to another page and then selects the ‘Back’ link to return to it. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.7 (redundant entry).
          <p>We plan to update these pages so that radio selections and text inputs are retained when validation errors occur, and when users navigate back to each page, by December 2024.</p>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Validation errors</h4>

          <p>It is not immediately clear to screen readers that a validation error is present on the screen. On pages that show an error message, the page titles do not have an 'Error:' prefix. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.1 (error identification).</p>
          <p>We plan to add the ‘Error:’ prefix to the page titles of all pages with validation errors by December 2024.</p>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Navigation</h4>

          <p>When using a screen reader’s alternative navigation with visual focus, the screen reader only skips to links and sortable column headings. It skips past all other page content. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.3 (focus order).</p>
          <p>When a table is sorted, the screenreader’s focus moves to the very top of the page, instead of back to the table. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.3 (focus order).</p>
          <p>We plan to change the table so that screen readers can consistently navigate through all of the content in the table without skipping, and so that the focus moves to the top of the table instead of the top of the page when the sort order changes, by December 2024.</p>

          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Sortable table headings</h4>

          <p>Sortable headings do not have aria labels that are recognised by screen reader software. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships), as well as WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role, value).</p>
          <p>Sortable headings do not state the column’s current sorting order. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships), as well as WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role, value).</p>
          <p>The screen reader doesn’t describe what action will be performed when users select the sortable header, or how to interact with this feature. Instead, the voiceover only describes “down pointing black pointer”. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships), as well as WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role, value).</p>
          <p>When the sorting order of a column is changed, there is no announcement for screen readers about the change in sorting order. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.1 (info and relationships), as well as WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role, value).</p>
          <p>We plan to update sortable tables so that screen readers recognise each sortable heading’s aria label, state the current sorting order, describe how to interact with the sorting arrows, and announce any changes to the sorting order when these happen. We plan to make these changes by December 2024.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
          
          <p>We conduct manual and automated accessibility testing for all major releases against the WCAG 2.2 criteria.</p>
          <p>We are working to make improvements to the non-accessible content described in this statement by December 2024. We aim to make all pages retain data that has been entered previously, indicate which pages have validation errors, allow users to navigate through tables using visual focus, and format sortable tables so that the status and function of interactive elements are recognised and described by screen readers. </p>
          <p>We will continue to iterate the design of the service to fix issues we are aware of.</p>
       
          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
          <p>This statement was prepared on 30 September 2024. It was last reviewed on 30 September 2024.</p>
          <p>The test was carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions. A sample of different types of pages were tested using automated and manual testing tools by our digital delivery teams.</p>
