          Apply for Personal Independence Payment (PIP)
        </h1>

        <p>Use this service to:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>make a claim for PIP</li>
            <li>describe how your health conditions or disabilities affect your ability to do certain everyday tasks and get around</li>
            <li>upload any supporting evidence you have of your conditions or disabilities and how they affect you</li>
          </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Before you start</h2>

        <p>You do not have to answer all the questions in one go. You can save your progress at any point and continue later.</p>

        <p>The date you submit this first stage will be the date of claim. The sooner you do this, the earlier your payments could begin if you're awarded PIP.</p>

        <p>For the first stage you will need:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>your personal details including National Insurance number</li>
          <li>your bank or building society account details, if you have one</li>
          <li>details of your health and care professionals</li>
          <li>hospital or care home details if you're staying or living in one</li>
