          <p class="govuk-body-s">Once the claimant has registered, the PIP Service router will automatically run rules based on what the claimant has entered.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body-s">If the rules to retain it in the new service are met and the service isn't at capacity it will continue through the thin slice. </p>
          <p class="govuk-body-s">A Case Worker will use the registration data to manually complete the eligibility checks using other systems like Customer Information System (CIS) / Searchlight. They will record the results of the eligibility checks on the new service.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body-s">Case Workers will have access to Agent Led Process' and guidance to support them with eligibility and other checks.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body-s">Eligibility checks include age, accommodation, overlapping benefits, residence and presence. Other assurance checks include checking data matches other systems.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body-s">If the answers to the eligibility question make it complicated, then it will be routed back to PIPCS for Business as Usual.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body-s">If the claimant doesn't meet the eligibility rules, the Case Worker will disallow them.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body-s">Some checks happen before it's sent for a Health Assessment and some happen after. Some checks will need to be repeated throughout the journey.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body-s">Once the Health Information Gather has been completed by the claimant and there are no further tasks, the case is referred to the Health Assessment Service (HAS).</p>
